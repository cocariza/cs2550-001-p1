			<h2>Coding</h2>
			<p>This haiku captures the coder's journey from excitement to confidence, only to be met with the inevitable frustration of an unexpected error. It reflects the highs and lows of programming, where progress feels exhilarating until a single mistake sends you back to debugging.</p>
			<p>
				This is getting fun<br>
				I am feeling confident<br>
				Shoot, there's an error.

			<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
			<p>
				I have always been fascinated by coding and software development. From an early age, I was always the one in my family who was tech-savvy. As I progressed in my studies, I found a deep interest in computer science, particularly in areas like web development, data security, and automotive software applications. The ability to solve problems creatively and build functional, efficient solutions excites me, and I hope to apply my skills in industries that push the boundaries of technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of technology, I enjoy hiking and exploring new places with my fiancé and dog. There's something incredibly refreshing about being in nature, especially in a world of revolutionzing tech. Hiking allows me to disconnect from screens, clear my mind, and challenge myself physically. Some of my favorite destinations include national parks, remote backcountry trails, and scenic coastal cliffs. I also appreciate the opportunity to travel and experience different cultures, cuisines, and landscapes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another interest of mine is motorsports, especially Formula 1. The combination of precision engineering, strategy, and high-speed competition makes it one of the most exciting sports to watch. I admire the level of detail that goes into building race cars, optimizing aerodynamics, and fine-tuning performance. My passion for cars extends beyond just watching races—I enjoy learning about vehicle dynamics, performance modifications, and automotive technology. One of my long-term goals is to integrate my computer science skills into the automotive or motorsport industry, whether through performance analytics, simulation software, or real-time telemetry systems.
