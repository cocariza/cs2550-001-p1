<!-- EXAMPLE CODE HEADER/DISCLAIMER
 
Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Christopher Ocariza
Submitted: 2/1/2025
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of 
the class.

Reflection:
This project was a great opportunity to dive deeper into HTML and CSS. I 
enjoyed the process of creating a structured webpage, learning about semantic 
elements, and styling my content to look professional. The most challenging 
part was working with the class schedule table because aligning the cells and 
color-coding the blocks required attention to detail and debugging. However, 
I’m proud of the final result, and I now feel much more confident in building 
and styling web pages.

enjoyed this project and look forward to learning more advanced web development
 concepts in future assignments.

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
          This haiku captures the coder's journey from excitement to confidence,
          only to be met with the inevitable frustration of an unexpected error.
          It reflects the highs and lows of programming, where progress feels
          exhilarating until a single mistake sends you back to debugging.
        </p>
        <p class="haiku">
          This is getting fun<br />
          I am feeling confident<br />
          Shoot, there's an error.

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by coding and software development. From
          an early age, I was always the one in my family who was tech-savvy. As
          I progressed in my studies, I found a deep interest in computer
          science, particularly in areas like web development, data security,
          and automotive software applications. The ability to solve problems
          creatively and build functional, efficient solutions excites me, and I
          hope to apply my skills in industries that push the boundaries of
          technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of technology, I enjoy hiking and exploring new places with my
          fiancé and dog. There's something incredibly refreshing about being in
          nature, especially in a world of revolutionzing tech. Hiking allows me
          to disconnect from screens, clear my mind, and challenge myself
          physically. Some of my favorite destinations include national parks,
          remote backcountry trails, and scenic coastal cliffs. I also
          appreciate the opportunity to travel and experience different
          cultures, cuisines, and landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interest of mine is motorsports, especially Formula 1. The
          combination of precision engineering, strategy, and high-speed
          competition makes it one of the most exciting sports to watch. I
          admire the level of detail that goes into building race cars,
          optimizing aerodynamics, and fine-tuning performance. My passion for
          cars extends beyond just watching races—I enjoy learning about vehicle
          dynamics, performance modifications, and automotive technology. One of
          my long-term goals is to integrate my computer science skills into the
          automotive or motorsport industry, whether through performance
          analytics, simulation software, or real-time telemetry systems.
